# Roll the Dice - a 2 Player Game

A game built with JavaScript ES6, HTML5 and CSS3.


## Rules

1. Each player can keep rolling the dice until a 1 is rolled, at which point that player's current points are lost and the turn goes to next player.
2. The current score is the active player's score while they're rolling dice, which keeps accumulating until a 1 is rolled or the player chooses to hold their score.
3. When the active player clicks the "hold" button, their current score is added to their overall score, and their turn ends.
4. The game keeps going until one of the players reaches an overall score of 100, at which point the game stops and winner is highlighed.
5. To start a new game click the "new game" button.
